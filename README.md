# 1pgrpg
A simple card-based approach to rpg combat.

## Development Stage
### Action Cards
Currently finishing off the illustrations for the action cards.

### Character Sheets
Currently working on generating the sheets programatically using a GUI application. 
I will provide blank sheets once I have a layout that I enjoy.

### Documentation
Though there aren't many rules, I want to make a short instruction 
manual explaning how to play the game. The rules are to be 
summarized on a single page (hence -> 1pgrpg).
